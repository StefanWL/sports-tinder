#SPRT

The hope of this app was to help people meet friends to play sports with.
That could be on team together or against each other.
We try to implement tinder's model but adapting it for meeting people for sports,

Technically it is built using PHP/Laravel using the Eloquent ORM to manage the complex data relationships.
The UI is rendered server-side with blade templates.
The main feature available to users are:
- Signing up
- Creating a profile
- Searching other user and teams profiles and liking or passing on them
- Chatting with other users after they've matched

Teams are also able to
- Create their own profiles
- Search other user and teams profiles and like or pass
- Have their own chat that other teams
